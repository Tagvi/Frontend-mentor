## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Open a lightbox gallery by clicking on the large product image
- Switch the large product image by clicking on the small thumbnail images
- Add items to the cart
- View the cart and remove items from it

## My process

This was my first time using TailwindCSS, it was quite confusing at the start, but gradually got easier, but in the end, I still think that it isn't my cup of tea, but at least I got the experience which I can use in future work projects if needed.

### Built with
