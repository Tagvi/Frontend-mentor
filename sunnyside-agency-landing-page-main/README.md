## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

This challenge was quite easy, but at first I had problems making the images 100% width because they weren't inside a div, took me quite a long time to figure out that I had to put them in divs but once I understood that I felt like a dumbass :D, other than that, challenge is quite easy and beginner friendly.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- GSAP animation library
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This was the first time I used burger menu navbar, I like it a lot and it creates quite a bit of space thus making navbar more minimalistic and lest cluttered.

### Continued development

I'm looking forward into using burger menu again.
