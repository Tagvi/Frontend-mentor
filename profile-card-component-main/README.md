## Overview

### The challenge

- Build out the project to the designs provided

## My process

When I started I thought this was gonna be easy, and it is, but I started without figuring out how I was going to divide sections and that complicated things a lot.
at the end I deleted some things and restarted the project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned that I need to think before building because not having figured out what you need makes things complicated.
