## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

The challenge took a long time, and I MEAN it. I started out the webpage as usual, building top to bottom, I built the nav and went onto the next one which is the first section, I thought using the curve svg was gonna be easy but then I realised it was going to be HARD ðŸ™„, I was thinking and thinking but couldn't come up with a solution because of my inexperience, so I decided to look into other people's solutions, @tediko's solution came up first and I think it was quite clever to use gradient, so I used it (Thanks! ðŸ’š). Other parts of the page weren't challenging but it still was time consuming, in the end I built out the PC version and added some animations on scroll and page load using GSAP.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- SCSS
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- GSAP animation library

### What I learned

Main thing I learned is that some things may look easy and be hard, so do not judge a book by it's cover!
