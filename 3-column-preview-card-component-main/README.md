## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process

I think this challenge was fairly easy, I started by importing the fonts and applying global styles, then I did mobile design and afterwards desktop design, at the end I had few problems which I fixed also quite easily.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I had to use git and github to upload this project to a repo. To be honest I had no idea how it worked so this project forced me to learn it.
Codwise there wasn't anything new as I recall.

### Continued development

I think my Flexbox is not the best and I need to refine it.

### Useful resources

- [Git and github tutorial](https://youtu.be/RGOj5yH7evk) - The video is quite helpful and concepts are explained well, highly reccomend this!
