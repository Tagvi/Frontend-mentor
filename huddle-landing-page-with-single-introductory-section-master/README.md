## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the page depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process
The challenge was quite easy, there wasn't much layout involved, I only needed to use flexbox once, I tried to make it as responsive as possible without `@media` queries, I used fluid widths and it helped me avoid using any queries for tablets. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Dart SCSS
- Parcel 


### What I learned

You can make beautiful pages without using a lot of code, also using fluid withs are awesome! âœ¨

### Continued development

Dart SCSS is awesome and I'm looking forward into learning it. ðŸš€
