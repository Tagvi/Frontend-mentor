## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size

## My process

The website was quite easy, adding styles took sime time in the start, I didn't need to think, it just took time because html doesn't come with tags and I had to create like 1000 tags and style them, I started with mobile and pc was super easy afterwards, anyways the challenge was really easy and I already knew what I needed to do from the start.

## Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Now I really understand that CSS grid can make things super easy, I already knew everything I needed but I didn't know grid has this much power.

### Continued development

I think grid is amazing and I will keep looking for cool grid ideas.
